I work as a Research Assistant at IHSAN Lab, Information Technology University (ITU), Lahore, Pakistan. My works strive to enable a trustworthy deployment of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), in real-world settings (ML as a service, ML on edge). Overall, my focus has been the adversarial robustness, security, privacy, interpretability and fairness of DNNs.
